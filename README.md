Project  Title: New York City TLC Project: Taxi Fare Prediction

Description:

Utilized machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model for taxi fare prices in New York City, aiming to optimize pricing strategies and improve customer satisfaction. Leveraged a dataset containing detailed trip information collected by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).

Key Contributions:

Data Preprocessing: Conducted comprehensive data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting data into training and testing sets to ensure model accuracy and generalization.

Model Selection and Optimization: Implemented and fine-tuned Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers using hyperparameter tuning techniques such as GridSearchCV to maximize predictive performance. Evaluated models based on various metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure robustness.

Model Evaluation: Employed cross-validation techniques to assess model performance and generalization on unseen data. Generated comprehensive result tables showcasing model performance metrics on both cross-validation and test datasets.

Visualization and Interpretation: Visualized the importance of features using techniques like feature importance plots, enabling stakeholders to gain insights into the factors influencing taxi fare prices. Additionally, utilized confusion matrix visualization to analyze model performance and identify areas for improvement.
